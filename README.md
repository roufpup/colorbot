This repository is facilitating the code for both fluxer-rs a very experimental and still work in progress rust library that interacts with the fluxer social media platform and the bot colorbot which will utilize fluxer-rs.

For opening issues and feature requests please head over to the MIRROR repo over on https://github.com/roufpup/colorbot

Feel free to join me and chat on Fluxer in the fluxer-rs server https://fluxer.gg/YpAOaODV

I will be doing my best to be implementing the API and gateway functionality as fast as i can so please bear with me.
